# traffic_violation_detection
Migration from village, semi urban to urban increased the population. There are many challenges due to migration, among those, usage of vehicles is the one. Due to large numbers of vehicles usage and lack of enough people to maintain traffic flow and capturing the traffic violation sometimes goes missing. Traffic violation management is a major concern in smart cities. The proposed system uses the Intelligent Agents (IA) which are distributed across the city so that it collects the violation by communicating with each other. The IA is an on-board built-in system inside the vehicle. The Agent receives committed traffic violations from the other vehicles along with vehicle information and Agents then set priority of violation then report it to the controller server for the collection of fines. The controller server communicates with external servers such as the Banking Regional Transport Office (RTO) to get details of the user and deduct fines from the user bank account directly. The usefulness of this proposal are: elimination detection of violations manually, corruption free agents, and builds a dataset which can be used for future prediction. Proposed system is validated by simulation by implementing the system using JAVA programming language.
